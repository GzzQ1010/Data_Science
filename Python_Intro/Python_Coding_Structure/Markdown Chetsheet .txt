Headings
Use the number sign (#) followed by a blank space for notebook titles and section headings:
# for titles
## for major headings
### for subheadings
#### for 4th level subheadings


Emphasis
Use the following code to emphasize text:
Bold text: __string__ or **string**
Italic text: _string_ or *string*

Mathematical symbols
Surround mathematical symbols with a dollar sign ($), for example:
$ mathematical symbols $

Monospace font
Surround text with a grave accent (`) also called a back single quotation mark, for example:
`string`

You can use the monospace font for file paths, file names, message text that users see, or text that users enter.

Line breaks
Sometimes markdown doesnâ€™t make line breaks when you want them. To force a linebreak, use the following code: <br>
Indenting
Use the greater than sign (>) followed by a space, for example:
> Text that will be indented when the Markdown is rendered.
